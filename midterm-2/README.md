## Exam

## Part 1 (10 pts)

Consider the following grammar, modified from the one from Homework 4:

```
Notation:
,     Concat
|     Alternative
<>    0 or more
{}    1 or more
[]    optional
()    Grouping
??    Special Form

program                 = {function_definition|comment} ;
function_definition     = "fn" , identifier , "(" , [arguments] , ")" , "{" , {statement} , "}" ;
arguments               = expression , { "," , expression } ;
statement               = (variable_define | function_return) ";", [comment] ;
variable_define         = "let" , identifier , "=" , expression ;
function_return         = "return" , (function_call | expression | value) ;
function_call           = identifier , "(" , [arguments] , ")" ;
expression              = boolean | math_expression | function_call | number | string | identifier ;
math_expression         = l1 ;  <--------- that's the change
value                   = number | identifier | boolean | string ;
number                  = {digit} ;
boolean                 = "true" | "false" ;
string                  = "\"" , {alnum | " "} , "\"" ;
identifier              = alpha , <alnum> ;
alpha                   = ?alphabetic or equivalent character?;
alnum                   = ?alphanumeric character?;
digit                   = 0..9;
whitespace              = space | tab | newline | carriage_return; 
comment                 = "//", ?any character?
```

This extension to the grammar allows us to define an order of operations for our language, so that we can be more flexible with how we write expressions:

```
l1 = l2, <l1_infix> ;
l1_infix = "+" | "-", l2 ;
l2 = l3, <l2_infix> ;
l2_infix = "*" | "/" , l3 ;
l3 = l4, <l3_infix> ;
l3_infix = "^", l4 ;
l4 = l5, <l4_infix> ;
l4_infix = "&&" | "||" , l5;
l5 = l6, <l5_infix> ;
l5_infix = "!=" | "==" | ">=" | ">" | "<=" | "<" , l6;
l6 = value | parenthetical_expression ;
parenthetical_expression = "(", l1, ")" ;
```

Write a parser for this grammar in Rust. You may use your HW4 submission or the HW4 solutions as a starting point.


## Part 2 (10 pts)

- Extend the grammar in some way by adding new definitions.
- Add additional token and node types to accomodate your extension.
- Extend your lexer to tokenize the new source code.
- Extend your parser to parse the new grammar extension.
- Make sure to tie your extension back to the original grammar in some way.

You can do whatever you want, but make sure you add at least two more grammar definitions.

Some suggestions:

- Loop statements
- If expressions
- Closures
- Modules
- Classes
- Something else of your choosing.

## Part 3 (5 pts)

Write at least 10 tests for your parser in the style of HW4. Make sure at least 2 of them test your new grammar definitions from pt. 2

## Part 4 - Code Demo and Explanation (10 pts)

This is the oral portion of the exam. You will record an explanation for your lexer which demonstrates its implementation and functionality. You don't have to show your face but you do have to record your voice (accommodations are available upon request). You should be sure to cover the following points in your discussion:

- Explain how your parser works and supports the new token/node variants (those beyond HW4). 
- Demonstrate examples where it works correctly.
- What challenges did you face? How did you overcome them?

If you didn't finish the exam in is entirety, explain how you attempted to solve it and where you got stuck. This will get you at least some points. 

You can use Zoom to do this, [here is a link](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360059781332-Getting-started-with-recording) to some instructions. You don't have to record your face, only your voice and the screen. Go through the answer and explain how you arrived there. Your goal with this question is to convince me you know what you are talking about, so I want you to do this without reading a script or written answer. Just go through line by line and explain what the program does. When you are done, upload your recording to your Lehigh Drive and add a link below.

## Submission

Please submit your completed exam, which should include:

1. The parser source code
2. Test cases demonstrating the correct lexing of the source code.
3. A recording link with permission to view granted to the link holder.

- Only files under version control in your forked assignment repository will be graded. Local files left untracked on your computer will not be considered.

- Only code committed *and pushed* prior to the time of grading will be accepted. Locally committed but unpushed code will not be considered.

- Your assignment will be graded according to the [Programming Assignment Grading Rubric](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V0nBt3Rz6uFMZ9mIaFioLF-48DFX0VdkbgRUDM_eIFk).

Your submission should be organized, well-commented, and easy to understand. Remember to document any assumptions you made during the implementation process, as well as any limitations of your solution. Your final exam will be graded on the correctness, completeness, and clarity of your submission.
